## fairfax-county-middle-school-boundaries

In this project, I explored how demographics factor into Fairfax County, Virginia Public Schools' Middle School boundaries. While this project focuses specifically on two particular boundaries -- the Rocky Run Middle School and Katherine Johnson Middle School boundaries -- it is intended to be reproducible for any boundary analysis within Fairfax County, whether on the elementary, middle, or high school levels since the source data: U.S. Census Bureau, Fairfax County, Fairfax County Public Schools, and the Virginia Department of Education, will be the same irrespective of boundary type.
